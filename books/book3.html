                <h4 class="author">Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter</h4>
                <p class="summary"><b>Rich Dad Poor Dad</b>, The story begins with the author as a young boy, observing the contrasting financial mindsets and behaviors of his two dads. His poor dad, who held a high position in education, emphasized the importance of academic success, job security, and living within one's means. On the other hand, his rich dad, a successful entrepreneur, believed in building assets, investing wisely, and acquiring financial knowledge. It describes how rich dad teaches the author and his friend
                finances by using actual life situations.
                
                Throughout the book, Kiyosaki shares anecdotes and conversations that he had with his rich dad, who guided him on
                various aspects of money, wealth creation, and financial independence. He learns valuable lessons about the difference
                between assets and liabilities, the power of financial education, and the importance of taking calculated risks.
                Kiyosaki emphasizes the significance of acquiring assets that generate income, such as real estate and businesses, as
                opposed to liabilities that drain money, such as excessive consumer debt and unnecessary expenses. He introduces
                concepts like the cash flow quadrant, which categorizes individuals as employees, self-employed, business owners, or
                investors, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each quadrant. </p>
